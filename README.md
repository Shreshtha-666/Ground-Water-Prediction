## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `Dynamic_2017_2_0.csv`. It contains various features relevant to groundwater availability, such as geographical and environmental factors.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to install the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib


pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib

##Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/groundwater-prediction.git
cd groundwater-prediction

Place the dataset:
Ensure that the 'Dynamic_2017_2_0.csv' file is in the same directory as the script.

Run the script:
python groundwater_prediction.py
The script will load the data, preprocess it, build, train, and evaluate the ANN model. It will also plot the training and validation loss and mean absolute error graphs.

##Model Architecture
The ANN model used in this project has the following architecture:

Input layer: Number of neurons equal to the number of features
Hidden layer 1: 64 neurons, ReLU activation
Hidden layer 2: 32 neurons, ReLU activation
Output layer: 1 neuron (for the regression output)
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function. Early stopping is used to prevent overfitting.

##Results
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared Score (RÂ²)
The script will print these metrics and plot the training and validation loss and MAE over the epochs.
